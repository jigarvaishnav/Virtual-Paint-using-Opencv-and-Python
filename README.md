# Virtual-Paint-using-Opencv-and-Python
Opencv Project to paint virtually using an object.

The first program ColorPicker.py can be used to pick the HSV values for a particular color. You can run the program with the image of the object you want to draw with and select that color by sliding the bars. 
The final values which you get after selecting a desired color can be added to the colors list in VirtualPaint.py.
If the values were selected correctly, you can run the Virtual Paint program and draw anything on the screen with the desired object using your webcam. It was a fun project and can be extended to draw using different colors.
